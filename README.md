This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the “Using GitHub Codespaces with this course” video to learn how to get started. 


 
In this course, electrical engineer and educator Barron Stone guides you through how to deploy quantum computing from a developer’s perspective. Learn about qubits, quantum logic gates and circuits, running quantum programs with Qiskit, three common quantum algorithms, and more. This course is a perfect companion to the course Introduction to Quantum Computing.
